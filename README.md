# inews-connect-mos
This project aims to adapt and extend our existing, UTF-8-compliant MOS device integration, originally built and successfully tested with the Octopus NRCS, to now work seamlessly with Avid iNEWS via MOS Gateway.

Our current implementation supports the core MOS protocol (v2.8.5) and has been validated in production environments with Octopus. The next milestone is to ensure compatibility with iNEWS workflows, message encoding expectations, connection lifecycle (handshakes, keepalives), and MOS Gateway-specific handling of rundowns, stories, and device status.

This repository is a fork of the original Octopus Connect gateway, adapted specifically for the Avid environment.

Key goals:

Ensure interoperability with the inews MOS Gateway (including proper response to heartbeat, roCreate, mosObjCreate, etc.).

Maintain strict UTF-8 encoding and compatibility with iNEWS character requirements.

Support bidirectional communication with iNEWS rundowns, including active rundown loading and status updates.


# Change log


## 2.2.0

- Implemented insertItem method - it covers new/duplicate/uniq cases: 
    * new - when the item id is 0
    * duplicate - when the item id already exists in items hash
    * uniq - the case when we get item id but its not exists in items hash. (Probably copy from other rundown that is not monitored). 
I need to check all edge cases - but for first look, the logic works fine and handles correctly cache and sql
- Refactored removeItemsMeta to normalize.js module (now we call it from items service and from octopus-service).
- Now we force types conversion in itec constructor, before saving to cache.
- We need to deeply debug and test the roItemInsert event with many scenarios - copy from offline rundown etc...

## 2.1.6

- RundownStr - is prop we carry from octopus project when roID and roSlug was different. Since in inews its same value - I try to remove it now from everywhere and simplify methods accross the project. Instead adding to each story rundownStr prop, and roID, i now avoid to adding rundownstr, also in cache methods adjustment was done.
- Added itemDelete method in itemsService - now we are handle the case of single item delete - reorder other items in story, save new story to cache and sql and update last updates. 


## 2.1.5

- Added prependSeparator and prependStringForEmptyPageNumber values to appConfig - they should be the same as on inews gateway mosconfig.xml.
- Added hanlding for replaceStory event - basically we replace there only story slug name and page (storyNum) - those are the only cases I found. 


## 2.1.4

- Refactored sql method modifyBbStoryOrdByStoryID to modifyBbStoryOrd (before we had 2 of them with minor diff).
- Now we can handle delete stories message that sends array of stories to delete (Added deleteStoriesHandler that runs over stories and trigger delete story for each)
- Now we are handle complex roStoryMoveMultiple MOS message that covers all story reorder/move even if user move group of stories. New method is moveMultiple - is quete hard to understand but have linear complexity, optimized to write only real changes, and tested for working in major edge cases. 

## 2.1.3

- Fixed getItemsArrByStoryID cache method.
- Added general comment to normalizeItem function.
- Done with replaceItem event.
- Added check for non-item storyAppend event (we then skip the event - this in case user choosed to send empty stories in mos gw settings).
- Started with roStoryInsert.
- Some function-level comments in octopus service. 

## 2.1.2

- Finished with roItemReplace == > it updates sql, and cache. Added updateItem methods in SQL , and in cache.
- Added conditional roItemReplace command constructor - according type 1 and 2.
- Cleaned items-service and octopus-service from old func (old modules saves as backup).

## 2.1.1

- In inews, new item wrapped in <ncsItem><item>, this is also the legal wrapper for item that sent by plugin, and in mosItemReplace.
But, once the item has been modyfied in inews (using "apply" or "Ok" buttons), the item struct is change, and the <ncsItem><item> ommited.
Added an little normalizer that flat the incoming items in stories to non <ncsItem><item> struct.
I did it in octopus-service/constructStory method.
- Added example for 2 types of item in mos-examples.js
- Added showRawMos debug option to show incoming mos messages before the parser(as str), while showMos will print the message after the parser (as object).
## 2.1.0

- Added missing mosItemBrowserProgID and mosItemEditorProgID to mosItemReplace template.

## 2.0.1

- Added SQL create scripts for ngn_inews_items, ngn_inews_rundowns and ngn_inews_stories.
- In ngn_inews_rundowns, the roID is nvarchar type (in octopus we get it as number).


## 2.0.0

- Updated all senders to UCS-2 big endian encoding"
```
Buffer.from(string, 'utf16le').swap16();
```
